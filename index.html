Data Inspector looks good, I want to see only Waste Collection operation thats why I only sent datas about this operation. Task status values show Done, Visited and To Do. Data look correct overall. Please proceed to full efficiency dashboard.

1:57 AM
I'll read the xlsx skill first, then examine all three data files to build the full efficiency dashboard.

Read the xlsx skill for best practices
Read the frontend-design skill for dashboard best practices
Now let me examine all three data files to understand the complete dataset:


3 steps

Deep dive into service points, visited/todo tasks, and zone performance



Analyze day of week patterns, planned vs adhoc, and vehicle utilization


Now I have all the data I need. Let me create a comprehensive efficiency dashboard:

Here's your full Waste Collection Efficiency Dashboard covering the week of January 5-11, 2026.

Key Findings:

Overall Performance: 90.2% completion rate (20,600 of 22,841 tasks)
Best Performers: Zone 1 (96.2%) and Zone 2 (93.2%); Night routes outperform day routes; REL 6 leads vehicles at 96.5%
Problem Areas: Zone 3 AlQan (56.9%), Zone 4 Bajdah (60.0%), Zone 4 AlSuru (70.6%) need urgent attention; REL 12 and REL 14 underperforming at ~75%
Pending Work: 2,241 incomplete tasks — 1,643 never visited (concentrated in Zone 2 C Night-1 and Zone 3 AlQan), 598 visited but not collected

I have a few questions regarding the analysis. Are the "Incomplete" tasks you mentioned the "Visited + To Do" tasks? If so, please separate them in the Daily Task Completion graph so we can apply route-based filters to that graph.
I noticed that some tasks in the Tasks file weren't assigned routes; these are all Ad Hoc tasks. I don't want you to include them in your analysis. If you have included them, exclude them accordingly. If not, create an explanation section at the bottom of the analysis and add this information so the user is aware. I removed them from the Tasks Excel file and am updating the file I uploaded to the project with its final version. I haven't made any other changes.
You mentioned 33 routes, but it's actually 35. Review the CIT_StaticTour Excel file again. Make sure you've included all routes. Add the included routes to the explanation section.
You mentioned 6 Zones; yes, you can tell which zone a region belongs to by looking at the Zone X at the beginning of the region name. But for example, there's a region called Sharma - ALD - Aldrees; did you include that? This doesn't fall under any of the 6 Zones. There was also a region name starting with Hanheld, but since there were no service points in that region, I removed its static tours from Excel. In the end, as you wrote, 33 routes remain. I'm also updating the Static Tour Excel file; I haven't made any other changes.
The Route Performance Rankings table doesn't have 33 routes; there are missing entries. Please complete this.
For the Explanation table, please add any explanations I haven't thought of.

Let me re-read the updated files and address all your points carefully.


1 step

Analyze adhoc vs planned tasks and route assignments



Compare static tour routes with task routes


I see there are naming inconsistencies between Static Tour and Tasks files (e.g., "Sharma - ALD - Aldrees" vs "Sharma-ALD-Aldrees", "Zone 4 - Nima - V 2.0" vs "Zone 4 - Nima V 2.0"). Let me now recalculate everything properly excluding Adhoc tasks:


Recalculate all metrics excluding adhoc tasks



Calculate vehicle, zone, and day of week metrics for planned tasks only


Now let me create the updated dashboard with all corrections:


1 step

Remove existing file to create updated version


Create correcte
Update Efficiency Dashboard according to my last feedback. I see there are naming inconsistencies between Static Tour and Tasks files (e.g., "Sharma - ALD - Aldrees" vs "Sharma-ALD-Aldrees", "Zone 4 - Nima - V 2.0" vs "Zone 4 - Nima V 2.0"). These pairs represent the same thing. You can proceed by thinking of them as if they are the same.

Here's your updated Waste Collection Efficiency Dashboard with all the corrections:

Changes Made:

Daily Task Completion chart — Now separates Done, Visited, and To Do as three distinct stacked bars with a route filter dropdown
Ad Hoc tasks excluded — Analysis now includes only the 20,087 planned tasks (2,519 ad hoc tasks removed)
33 routes confirmed — Updated Static Tour file now has 33 routes (Bin Washer and HandHeld routes removed), and all 33 are included in the Route Performance table
Sharma-ALD included — Shown as a 7th operational area alongside the 6 numbered zones
Route naming — Noted in explanations that naming variations between Static Tour and Tasks files (like "Sharma - ALD - Aldrees" vs "Sharma-ALD-Aldrees") are treated as equivalent
Comprehensive Explanations section added covering:
Data scope & exclusions (why ad hoc was removed)
Task status definitions (Done/Visited/To Do)
All 7 operational areas and their route counts
Complete list of all 33 routes
Route naming conventions/variations

Please also include ad hoc tasks. I want you to include all tasks currently in the Tasks Excel file, totaling 22,606 tasks, both ad hoc and planned. Show the breakdown of ad hoc and planned tasks on a KPI card.

11:53 PM
Let me recalculate all metrics including both Planned and Ad Hoc tasks.

Updated metrics now reflect all tasks:
Overall completion rate: 91.1% (20,600 of 22,606 done)
Total collections: 20,603 bins
Zone and route performance recalculated with all tasks
Explanation section updated — Now describes both Planned (88.9%) and Ad Hoc (11.1%) tasks
All other features retained:

What does Pending Tasks mean? Why it is not 2606?

11:59 PM
You're right to question this. Let me clarify:

Pending Tasks (2,006) = Tasks that were NOT completed successfully

To Do (1,408): Service point was never visited
Visited (598): Service point was visited but bin was not collected
The math:

Total tasks: 22,606
Done: 20,600
Not Done (Pending): 22,606 - 20,600 = 2,006 ✓
So the "Pending Tasks" KPI shows tasks that still need attention (either never visited or visited but not collected). It's not 2,606 because that would imply a different calculation.

The number 2,006 is correct because:

1,408 (To Do) + 598 (Visited) = 2,006 incomplete tasks
Would you like me to change the label or description on this KPI card to make it clearer? For example:

"Incomplete Tasks" instead of "Pending Tasks"
Or adjust the subtitle to say "Not completed: 1,408 To Do · 598 Visited"

The dashboard content is currently as I want it; we just need to make some changes to the color palette to make it suitable for our branding. I'll send you a few screenshots of our UI so you can understand our branding. I'm also sending you the color palette:
rgb(11, 43, 81)
rgb(255, 255, 255)
rgb(54, 155, 49)
rgb(54, 155, 49)
rgb(16, 24, 40)
rgb(224, 60, 57)
rgb(251, 230, 230)
Not only the color palette, but also the component aesthetics and details like the font should be adapted to our branding. My goal is for the screen you create to look completely harmonious and not look out of place when we implement it.
While doing this, please don't change the content; the content is currently quite high-quality and should definitely continue this way.

12:13 AM
I can see your Evreka 360 platform branding clearly from the screenshots. Let me analyze the design system:

Color Palette:

Primary dark blue: rgb(11, 43, 81) - sidebar, headers
White: rgb(255, 255, 255) - backgrounds, cards
Green: rgb(54, 155, 49) - success states, "Active" badges
Dark text: rgb(16, 24, 40) - primary text
Red: rgb(224, 60, 57) - error/warning states
Light red bg: rgb(251, 230, 230) - passive/ended badges background
UI Characteristics observed:

Clean white/light gray backgrounds
Dark blue sidebar navigation
Rounded badges with colored backgrounds
Simple, professional sans-serif font
Subtle borders and shadows
Green for positive/active states
Tables with light headers and clean rows
Let me update the dashboard to match your branding:


1 step

Create Evreka-branded waste collection efficiency dashboard
waste_collection_efficiency_dashboard.html

Presented file
Here's the dashboard redesigned to match Evreka 360's branding:

Branding Changes Applied:

Colors: Primary dark blue rgb(11, 43, 81), Evreka green rgb(54, 155, 49), white backgrounds, red rgb(224, 60, 57) for critical states
Font: Inter (matching your UI's clean sans-serif)
Background: Light gray rgb(248, 250, 252) with white cards (matching your app's light theme)
Badges: Rounded badges with light colored backgrounds (like your Active/Passive/Ended badges)
Cards: White backgrounds with subtle borders and shadows
Tables: Light gray headers, clean borders matching your Routes & Tasks table style
Charts: Colors aligned with your branding (green for success, amber for warning, red for critical)
Overall aesthetic: Clean, professional, minimal - consistent with your Evreka 360 interface
The content remains exactly the same - only the visual styling has been updated to integrate seamlessly with your platform.

rgb(11, 43, 81)
For example, I imagined this color as the very back background color, with sections that have a white background color - like you're doing now. Do it this way.

12:19 AM
I understand - you want the dark blue rgb(11, 43, 81) as the page background with white cards on top, similar to your sidebar/main content contrast. Let me update that.

Update table container styling for dark background

waste_collection_efficiency_dashboard.html

Presented file
Done! The dashboard now has:

Dark blue background rgb(11, 43, 81) as the page background
White cards floating on top with subtle shadows
Removed the card borders since the contrast with the dark background provides enough visual separation
This creates the same visual hierarchy as your Evreka 360 sidebar/content area relationship - the dark blue frames the content while the white cards stand out clearly.
